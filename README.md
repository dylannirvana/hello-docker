This project is based on the official Docker tutorial https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/ using part of the getting-started repo https://github.com/docker/getting-started 

I have found that and other documentation on Docker, inaccurate and cumbersome, and have assembled this Book of Spells, which I feel is a better narrative for learning Docker.
